# Log of model runs:

## To do : 28/2-20

- Run with output every hour at stations specifically -- hourly mean. 
- List from aerocom and or my own compiled --> got error because too many locations
- From this I can sample with gd input from Asmi et al 2011

Model runs:
check (data_info/case_overview.csv)[data_info/case_overview.csv]

### Analysis:
- Work on code for producing N50 etc for stations from h1
- 
NORESM2:
- Copy files
- Compare to original
